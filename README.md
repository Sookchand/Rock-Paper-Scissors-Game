## Demo
This code first checks if the user‚Äôs input is valid. If it is, it determines the winner based on the game rules. If the computer‚Äôs choice is equal to what the player‚Äôs choice beats (according to the game_rules list), then the player wins. If both choices are the same, it‚Äôs a draw. Otherwise, the computer wins.
## Tech Stack
It‚Äôs created using Python, which is a high-level, interpreted programming language. Python is known for its simplicity and readability, which makes it a great choice for beginners who are just starting to learn programming.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the Tech stack used:

Python: This is the programming language used to write the game. Python is known for its simplicity and readability, which makes it a great choice for beginners who are just starting to learn programming.

Built-in Python functions: The game uses several built-in Python functions, such as print() for displaying messages to the user, input() for getting input from the user, and int() for converting the user‚Äôs input to an integer.

Python data structures: The game uses lists to store the different choices (rock, paper, scissors) and strings to represent each choice.

Control flow statements: The game uses if statements to implement the game logic based on the user‚Äôs and computer‚Äôs choices.
## Documentation
Here are some resources that you can refer to for creating the game:

[Python For Beginners | Python.org]: This is the official Python website‚Äôs guide for beginners. It provides a brief tutorial that gives you basic information about the language and gets you started. You can follow this by looking at the library reference for a full description of Python‚Äôs many libraries and the language reference for a complete explanation of Python‚Äôs syntax.

[The Python Tutorial ‚Äî Python 3.11.5 documentation]: This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.

[Python Tutorial - W3Schools]: W3Schools offers an interactive Python tutorial with a ‚ÄúTry it Yourself‚Äù editor, where you can edit Python code and view the result.
## Lessons Learned

Understanding Basic Python Syntax: This includes learning how to use print statements, variables, and the input function.

Control Flow: Getting hands-on experience with Python‚Äôs control flow tools, including if-else statements. These are fundamental to many types of programming tasks.

User Interaction: This game involves getting input from the user and responding accordingly, which is a common requirement in software development.

Problem Solving: Creating a game like this requires you to think logically and solve problems, such as how to guide the user through the game and respond to their choices.

Creativity: Designing a game allows you to be creative in terms of the storyline, challenges, and outcomes you create for the player.

Debugging: As with any programming project, encountering bugs and figuring out how to fix it.
